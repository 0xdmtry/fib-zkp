# Halo2 Fibonacci SNARK

This project is for demonstration of a complete, two-party zero-knowledge proof application built with the Halo2 proving system. It showcases how a **Prover** can generate a succinct proof for a custom arithmetic circuit, and how a separate **Verifier** can check that proof.

## About The Project

The project proves a 10-step Fibonacci sequence calculation. It is structured to model a real-world scenario where two parties interact using a SNARK. The core of the project is a custom circuit, which is a highly specialized, efficient, and non-interactive way to prove a specific computation.

This project demonstrates the primary advantage of custom SNARKs: generating incredibly small, efficient proofs.

## Project Structure

The project is a Cargo workspace containing three distinct crates:

```
halo2-fibonacci/
├── fib-circuit/      # A shared library defining the Fibonacci circuit logic.
├── prover/           # The Prover application that generates the proof.
└── verifier/         # The Verifier application that checks the proof.
```

-----

## Setup

This project uses the `pasta_curves` backend, and no special toolchain installation is required. Simply ensure you have a recent version of Rust and Cargo installed.

To build the project, run the following command from the root directory:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

-----

## How to Run

The workflow involves two distinct steps. The prover must be run first to generate the necessary files for the verifier.

### 1\. Run the Prover

This command will compile and run the prover. It will generate three files in the `artifacts/` directory: `vk.bin` (the verifying key), `proof.bin`, and `public_inputs.bin`.

```bash
cargo run --release --bin prover
```

**Expected Prover Output:**

```
✅ Proof and Verifying Key saved successfully.
```

### 2\. Run the Verifier

This command runs the separate verifier application. It will load the files from the `artifacts/` directory and verify the proof.

```bash
cargo run --bin verifier
```

**Expected Verifier Output:**

```
✅ Proof verified successfully!
```

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

  * **Custom Circuits**: Unlike a zkVM, Halo2 is used to build a fixed-size, highly specialized arithmetic circuit for a single purpose, resulting in extremely efficient proofs.
  * **Two-Party Flow**: The prover generates a proof and public inputs. The verifier uses these, along with a verifying key, to confirm the computation's validity without re-executing it.
  * **Key Generation**: We demonstrated the one-time setup where a **Proving Key (PK)** and **Verifying Key (VK)** are generated from a set of public parameters (the SRS).
  * **Succinctness**: A key takeaway is the size of the final proof (`proof.bin` is \~1 KB), which is a dramatic difference from the larger proofs generated by general-purpose zkVMs. This makes SNARKs ideal for on-chain applications where data size is critical.
